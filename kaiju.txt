Problem A: Kaiju Threat Levels
Problem Description:
Four giant Kaijus are attacking the city! Each Kaiju has a unique DNA string made up of 4
capital letters (A–Z). Each letter has a numeric value:
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
...
Z = 26
Your Tasks:
1. Get the DNA string for Kaiju1, Kaiju2, Kaiju3, and Kaiju4.
2. Calculate the threat level of each Kaiju by adding up the value of each letter.
3. Print each Kaiju's threat level.
4. Determine and print which Kaiju is the most dangerous (i.e., has the highest threat level).
5. If two or more Kaijus have the same highest threat level, print "It's a tie!".
Hint:
There is a function in Python with the letters "d", "o", and "r" that takes a string and returns its
numerical representation — you may be able to leverage this in your code.
