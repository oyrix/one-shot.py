Problem Description:
You are tasked with finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

To calculate the GCD, you will use Euclid’s Algorithm:

If the second number divides the first number evenly, the GCD is the second number.

Otherwise, replace the first number with the second number, and the second number with the remainder of the first number divided by the second number.

Repeat this process until the remainder is zero; the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

Your Tasks:

Ask the user to input two positive integers.

Apply Euclid’s Algorithm to compute the GCD.

Print the GCD.

Optionally, print the steps of the algorithm for clarity.

Hint:
The modulo operator % in Python can be used to find the remainder of a division. You may also use a loop to repeatedly apply the algorithm until you find the GCD.
